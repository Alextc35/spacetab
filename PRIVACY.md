# NewDeskTab Privacy Policy

Last updated: September 9, 2026

NewDeskTab replaces the browser's new tab page with a customizable bookmark
workspace. It does not require a NewDeskTab account or use a NewDeskTab-operated
backend. This policy describes the extension, including its local storage,
optional Google Chrome synchronization, and requests for external images.

## Information used by NewDeskTab

NewDeskTab stores the bookmarks you enter or import, including their names, URLs,
layout, appearance and creation/update timestamps. It also stores folders,
workspaces, presets and settings such as language and theme. Images selected
from your device are processed in the browser; their optimized image data and
original filenames are stored in the extension's local storage.

NewDeskTab uses this information to display, edit, search, save and restore your
workspace. It requests the `storage` permission for this purpose. It does not
read your general browsing history, browser bookmark library, passwords or
other websites' page contents. Its search operates on your NewDeskTab bookmarks.

## Local storage and optional synchronization

NewDeskTab starts in Local mode, using `chrome.storage.local` inside your browser
profile. This describes where workspace data is saved; external images can
still cause network requests in Local mode, as explained below.

If you enable Sync in supported Google Chrome, bookmark data and shared
settings are stored using `chrome.storage.sync`. Chrome manages transfer and
availability according to your browser profile and Google Account settings.
NewDeskTab also stores synchronization metadata, including a generated device
identifier and update timestamps, to distinguish local and remote changes.
The extension does not give its developer access to that synchronized data.

Local image files, filenames and device-specific image selections are not sent
to Sync. Configured remote image URLs are part of the shared workspace data.
See [Google's privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) for Google's
handling of its services.

## Requests for favicons and other images

When a view or editor displays a website icon, NewDeskTab requests it from Google's
favicon service at `https://t3.gstatic.com/faviconV2`. The request includes the
bookmark site's origin (scheme, hostname and any port), with a leading `www.`
or `app.` removed. It does not include the bookmark URL's path, query string or
fragment. Hosts ending in `.internal` or `.local` use generated initials instead.
These exclusions do not cover every possible private hostname or IP address.

When a remote background image is displayed, the browser requests its configured
URL from the image host. The initial example workspace includes an image from
`cdn.osxdaily.com`, so this request may happen on first use. Requests can also
occur while previews are displayed, without opening a bookmark's website.

Image providers receive the requested URL and ordinary connection/request
information, such as your IP address and browser headers. Browser privacy and
cookie settings apply. NewDeskTab does not operate these image services or control
their logging or retention. Replacing remote images with local files or removing
the remote URLs avoids those particular image requests. Favicons may still be
requested by views that display website icons.

Opening a bookmark navigates to its destination; that website's policies then
apply. External images are displayed as images, not executed as extension code.

## Exports, retention and deletion

Import reads a file you select; export creates a JSON download on your device.
NewDeskTab does not upload these files to the developer. Exports contain bookmark
and workspace data and may include local image references, but do not embed the
locally stored image files. Keep those original files if you need them on another
device. Exported JSON files are not encrypted by NewDeskTab.

Workspace data is retained in the browser until you change or remove it.
Deleting a bookmark removes the record but does not necessarily erase unused
image files from extension storage. Returning to Local mode retains the Sync
copy. Settings provides an explicit action to delete NewDeskTab's synchronized
data; when needed, it first preserves the working data locally. To remove local
data and stored image files, clear the extension's storage using browser tools
or remove the extension. Delete exported files separately. Google controls the
retention of data within its services.

## Analytics, advertising and support

NewDeskTab includes no analytics or advertising SDK and sends no telemetry to a
NewDeskTab server. Optional debug output stays in the browser console. If you
choose to share a backup, screenshot or debug output for support, that information
is then available to its recipients.

NewDeskTab uses and transfers user data only to provide the workspace features
described here, consistent with the Chrome Web Store User Data Policy and its
Limited Use requirements. The developer does not sell workspace data, use it for
advertising or credit decisions, or receive it through an extension backend.

For questions about NewDeskTab or this policy, use the
[NewDeskTab project support page](https://github.com/Alextc35/newdesktab/issues).
That page is public: do not post private bookmarks or backup files there.
