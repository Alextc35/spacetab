### Summary

> A customizable new tab with editable bookmarks

### Detailed description

> Spacetab replaces Chrome's New Tab page with a private, customizable visual
> workspace for your bookmarks.
>
> Arrange bookmarks and folders on a flexible grid, resize and style cards,
> switch between independent workspaces, search across saved items, and create
> reusable appearance presets. Import and export bookmarks or create a complete
> local backup whenever you need one.
>
> Data is stored locally by default. Optional Chrome Sync uses browser-managed
> storage so compatible Chrome profiles can share bookmark data and settings.
> Images uploaded from your device remain local to that browser profile.
>
> Spacetab has no account system, advertising, analytics, telemetry, or
> developer-operated backend.

## Privacy answers

### Single purpose

> Replace Chrome's New Tab page with a customizable visual workspace for
> organizing and opening bookmarks supplied by the user.

### Permission justification: storage

> The storage permission saves the user's bookmarks, folders, workspaces,
> layout, appearance settings, optional local images, and synchronization
> preference. When the user explicitly enables Sync, browser-managed
> chrome.storage.sync stores the shareable workspace data; local image files
> and filenames remain in chrome.storage.local.

### Remote code

Select **No**. All executable JavaScript and CSS ships inside the extension ZIP.
Remote favicon and background-image responses are displayed as images and are
not executed as code.

### Data handling checklist

- User-entered bookmark names and URLs, workspace data and settings are stored
  by the extension to provide its single purpose.
- Files selected as local images are processed and stored locally in the
  browser profile.
- When a favicon is shown, the bookmark origin may be requested from Google's
  `t3.gstatic.com` favicon service as documented in the privacy policy.
- User-configured remote images are requested directly from their image hosts.
- SpaceTab does not read general browsing history, website page contents,
  passwords, authentication data, personal communications or location.
- SpaceTab has no developer-operated data collection, analytics or advertising.
- Certify compliance with the Chrome Web Store Limited Use requirements.

Match the dashboard's current data-category checkboxes to these statements and
to `PRIVACY.md`; do not claim that locally processed data is outside the policy.
